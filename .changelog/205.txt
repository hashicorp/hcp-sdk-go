```release-note:improvement
All credentials (login, service-principal and workload identity provider) are now cached.

The cache file has moved to `creds-cache.json` to not interfere with applications that rely on the previous cache file
structure.

It is further now possible to enforce an interactive login (via a configuration flag), which can be used to implement a
`cli login` functionality.
