```release-note:improvement
Adds a hcpConfig.Logout() method. Logout could previously be implemented by invalidating the cache. This now isn't possible anymore as the cache is not exported.

This change further removes the recently introduced forceLogin configuration value, as force login can easily be implemented by invoking hcpConfig.Logout() followed by hcpConfig.Token() without the need for a special configuration setting.
